Problem 2:

While purging files from the inventory, there is no way to search for files that have been labelled as "Past Kill Date".

Research:

Files within the inventory are assigned a manual "Past Kill Date", which serves as a visual indicator for the user to know which files are generally safe to purge from the system (files that are no longer needed/no longer airing).
There exists no function within the custom filters that allows the user to return files that have been labelled "Past Kill Date" (see image "2A").

Solution:

I created a new function called "PAST KILL DATE" which, when called upon, will return all files that have a kill date less than or equal to the current day's date (see image "2B").

Result:

The user is now able to call upon this new function which returns ALL files that have been labelled as "Past Kill Date" (see image "2C").
