This folder contains examples of functions I have created in order to improve usability and functionality within an inventory system I use at work known as "Sundance Media Prep"**. Each "Problem" subfolder contains a README file, which serves as a companion to the accompanying images within the folder, and details the problem, my research of the problem, my solution to the problem, and the result of that solution.
